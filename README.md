# Capstone_Project
A News app for the final project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.

This app uses the newsapi sources to retrieve data on the latest news specific to the user's interests.

To run this app you need to set up [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup "Add Firebase to Your Android Project")

Then you need to add the google-services.json file to the app folder.
